# README.md

### These are my solutions to project Euler problems which I wrote using the language R.

# ***Warning: Please do not use these as a solution guide***
### Project Euler is an amazing resource which makes our mind to think beyond its limits. Let's keep it that way
### I am using this as a repo to save my progress as I lost my code atleast 3 times till now and had to rebuild it. Kindly use it as an source but try writing your own code.

## Congrats and all the best for starting work on Project Euler.! :)
